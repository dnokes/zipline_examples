1) Install Anaconda Python

https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

2) Use the provided environment.yml file in the setup folder to replicate my environment. 

Zipline cannot run in the most recent version of Python (3.8) so you first have to create an environment for Python 3.5., then add the required packages.

Once Annaconda is installed you can replicate my environment with the following command

conda env create -f environment.yml

The following resource  is helpful for troubleshooting:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment

3) Apply zipline bug fixes

You will need to edit a number of .py files associated with Zipline. Follow the instructions found under the link immediately beginning from the 'Zipline installation best practice' section:

https://pypi.org/project/zipline-norgatedata/ 

The edited files I use are available in my repository in the setup folder.

The paths on your box will be something like this where you replace 'Derek' with your own user.

C:\Users\Derek\Anaconda3\envs\env_zipline\Lib\site-packages\zipline\data
C:\Users\Derek\Anaconda3\envs\env_zipline\Lib\site-packages\trading_calendars

4) Create data bundles

Finally, you will have to create some 'bundles'. The extension.py file in the setup folder contains the equity bundles I use for various different things.

On my desktop it is located under

C:\Users\Derek\.zipline

Instructions can be found under the 'Bundle Creation' section of the zipline-norgatedata docs referenced above.
